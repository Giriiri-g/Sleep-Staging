8. Title : Multimodal Cardiovascular Risk Profiling Using Self-Supervised Learning of Polysomnography
Abstract

This paper presents a self-supervised deep learning framework to extract cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers directly from raw polysomnography (PSG) signals. Without relying on sleep-stage annotations or handcrafted features, the model learns latent representations from EEG, ECG, and respiratory signals and converts them into interpretable projection scores associated with multiple cardiovascular outcomes. The approach is trained on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort and externally validated on the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC), demonstrating consistent improvements over traditional risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score. 

250709009v1

Introduction

The introduction motivates the work by highlighting the strong but underutilized relationship between sleep physiology and cardiovascular health. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep assessment, clinical practice typically compresses it into coarse summary indices (e.g., AHI, sleep efficiency), losing rich temporal and multimodal information. The authors argue that supervised models require extensive labeling and often focus on single modalities (mostly ECG), whereas self-supervised learning can exploit large-scale unlabeled PSG data to uncover latent disease-relevant physiological patterns. The paper positions itself as the first systematic attempt to use unsupervised multimodal PSG embeddings for long-term cardiovascular risk profiling.

Data and Preprocessing

The primary dataset is SHHS, comprising over 6,000 participants, with 4,398 retained after quality control. Overnight PSG recordings include EEG, ECG, and respiratory signals sampled at different frequencies (EEG/ECG at 125 Hz; respiration at 10 Hz). Minimal preprocessing is applied to preserve raw physiological structure; signals are segmented into 30-second windows without manual sleep staging. External validation is conducted using the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort, which differs demographically and in PSG acquisition protocols, strengthening generalizability claims.

Methodology

The methodological core is a self-supervised residual–transformer architecture trained via masked signal reconstruction. PSG segments are embedded into a 256-dimensional latent space using residual blocks for local patterns and transformer layers for long-range dependencies. A similarity loss combined with a Total Coding Rate regularization prevents representational collapse.
A key innovation is the derivation of disease vectors, computed as the difference between latent centroids of disease-positive and disease-negative groups. Individual-level projection scores are obtained by projecting a subject’s embeddings onto these vectors, yielding interpretable scalar measures of alignment with disease-specific physiological patterns. These scores are then used in downstream logistic regression models alongside traditional covariates.

Results

The results show strong modality-specific patterns: ECG-derived scores are highly predictive of cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure; EEG-derived scores are associated with hypertension and cardiovascular mortality; respiratory signals provide complementary predictive value. Combining projection scores with Framingham Risk Score consistently improves AUCs across prevalent and incident outcomes, with robust replication in the external cohort.

Discussion

The discussion emphasizes that raw PSG contains latent cardiovascular risk information beyond conventional sleep metrics. The authors highlight interpretability as a key strength, since projection scores provide continuous, clinically meaningful indicators rather than black-box predictions. Limitations include reliance on cohort-level disease labels to define vectors and the need for further prospective validation. The study concludes that self-supervised PSG analysis can augment existing cardiovascular risk stratification pipelines.

9. Title : A Foundation Model for Sleep-Based Risk Stratification and Clinical Outcomes
Abstract

This paper introduces a large-scale foundation model for sleep health that integrates raw PSG time-series data with longitudinal electronic medical records. Using a transformer-based architecture trained on over 10,000 PSG studies, the model generates embeddings that capture latent sleep physiology. Unsupervised clustering of these embeddings reveals distinct sleep-based risk groups with strong associations to cardiovascular disease, neurological outcomes, and all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up. External validation confirms robustness, positioning the model as a clinically scalable risk stratification framework. 

nihpp-rs6307069v1

Introduction

The introduction critiques current sleep medicine practices, particularly the overreliance on single summary measures like the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI). While PSG captures multimodal physiological data across several hours, most of this information is discarded during diagnosis. The authors argue that recent advances in foundation models—successful in language and vision—can be adapted to time-series PSG data to learn general-purpose representations. The goal is not just prediction, but discovery of latent sleep phenotypes associated with long-term disease trajectories.

Data and Preprocessing

The study uses the STARLIT-10K clinical cohort from the Cleveland Clinic, consisting of in-laboratory PSG recordings collected over a decade and paired with rich EMR data. Signals include EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, airflow, respiratory effort, SpO₂, snoring, and EtCO₂. Data are resampled to 128 Hz, filtered using modality-specific band-pass or high-pass filters, normalized, and segmented into 30-second epochs, each further divided into 3-second patches to align with clinical scoring conventions.

Methodology

A RoBERTa-based transformer is adapted for time-series modeling by replacing token embeddings with linear projections of PSG patches. The model is trained in a supervised multitask setting to predict sleep stages, respiratory events, and oxygen desaturations, ensuring physiologically meaningful embeddings. The CLS token output serves as a compact representation of entire PSG epochs and nights.
Unsupervised clustering (primarily k-means with energy distance) is then applied to these embeddings, yielding stable solutions with two to five clusters. These clusters are interpreted post hoc as risk groups, ranked by observed disease incidence and mortality.

Results

Five distinct risk groups are identified, with a clear monotonic increase in cardiovascular, neurological, and mortality risk from the lowest- to highest-risk group. The highest-risk cluster shows markedly elevated hazard ratios for myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality, even after adjusting for age, BMI, comorbidities, and AHI. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis confirms strong separation between groups. External validation using SHHS reproduces these associations, particularly for the simplified two-cluster solution.

Discussion

The discussion argues that learned sleep embeddings capture multidimensional physiological disruptions that conventional PSG metrics cannot. The authors emphasize that AHI-based severity grading fails to predict long-term outcomes as effectively as the embedding-derived risk groups. Strengths include large-scale longitudinal data, external validation, and clinical interpretability of clusters. Limitations include retrospective design, lack of treatment adherence data, and the need for prospective clinical trials. The paper concludes by framing sleep foundation models as a paradigm shift for personalized sleep medicine and risk stratification.
